## 7. biggest challenge(technical challenge)

In my previous role, I worked on designing and implementing an online banking system for Citizens Bank. One of the biggest technical challenges we faced was handling high transaction volumes and concurrent user requests efficiently, particularly during peak times such as salary disbursements or during periods of market volatility.

**Challenge**:
The main challenge was to ensure that the system could scale dynamically to handle varying loads and maintain low latency in transaction processing and real-time data access. This was crucial to providing a seamless user experience and maintaining the integrity of financial transactions.

**Details**:

1. **Load Balancing**: We needed to efficiently distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of our microservices to prevent any single instance from becoming a bottleneck.
2. **Auto-scaling**: It was essential to dynamically scale our infrastructure to handle sudden spikes in traffic, ensuring that the system remained responsive and performant.
3. **Latency**: Minimizing latency was critical for real-time operations, such as balance inquiries and fund transfers, to meet user expectations and maintain transaction integrity.

**Solution**:
To address these challenges, we implemented the following strategies:

1. **Kubernetes for Container Orchestration and Auto-scaling**:

   - We used Kubernetes to orchestrate our microservices, which allowed us to deploy, manage, and scale our applications efficiently.
   - Kubernetes' auto-scaling capabilities enabled us to automatically adjust the number of running instances based on current load, ensuring that we had enough resources to handle peak traffic without over-provisioning during off-peak times.

2. **Horizontal Scaling for Microservices**:

   - We designed our microservices to be stateless, enabling them to be horizontally scalable. This meant we could easily add more instances to handle increased load.
   - Each microservice was deployed as a Docker container, managed by Kubernetes, which made it simple to scale out by adding more containers as needed.

3. **Optimizing Database Queries and Indexing**:

   - We optimized our database queries to ensure they were efficient and could handle large volumes of transactions. This involved writing efficient SQL queries, using proper indexing strategies, and periodically reviewing and optimizing database performance.
   - For frequently accessed data, we utilized read replicas to distribute the load and reduce latency.

4. **Caching Mechanisms with Redis**:

   - We implemented Redis for caching frequently accessed data, such as user session information and account balances. This reduced the load on our databases and significantly improved response times for repeated requests.
   - By caching critical data, we could serve many requests directly from the cache, minimizing the need to query the database and thus reducing latency.

5. **Load Balancing**:
   - We used a combination of hardware and software load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of our services. This ensured that no single instance was overwhelmed with too many requests.
   - Implementing round-robin and least-connection strategies allowed us to balance the load effectively and maintain high availability.

**Outcome**:
These measures collectively ensured that our system could handle high transaction volumes and concurrent user requests efficiently, even during peak times. By leveraging Kubernetes for orchestration and auto-scaling, optimizing our database interactions, and using Redis for caching, we were able to provide a responsive and reliable online banking experience for our users.

## 9.Prepare stories based on your resume: example, where did you use multithreading in your last project? Where did you use builder design patterns in your last project?

Here are some stories based on your resume that illustrate your experience with multithreading and the Builder design pattern:

### Story 1: Using Multithreading at Citizens Bank

**Question**: Where did you use multithreading in your last project?

**Answer**:

In my role at Citizens Bank, I worked on developing a microservices-based online banking platform. One of the key challenges we faced was ensuring that the system could handle a high volume of concurrent transactions, especially during peak times like salary disbursements.

**Scenario**: We needed to process a large number of secure fund transfers between accounts simultaneously without causing delays or overloading the system.

**Solution**:
To address this, I implemented multithreading in the Fund Transfer Service. Here’s how:

1. **Concurrent Processing of Fund Transfers**:

   - I used the Java `ExecutorService` to manage a pool of threads that handled fund transfer requests concurrently. This allowed us to process multiple transfers in parallel, significantly reducing the overall processing time.

2. **Asynchronous Messaging with RabbitMQ**:

   - We integrated RabbitMQ to handle the queuing of fund transfer requests. Each message in the queue represented a transfer request, which was processed by a separate thread from the thread pool. This decoupling ensured that the main application thread remained responsive, and we could scale the number of worker threads based on the system load.

3. **Ensuring Data Consistency and Integrity**:
   - Implementing multithreading introduced potential risks of data inconsistency. To mitigate this, I used synchronized blocks and locks where necessary to ensure that account balances were updated atomically. Additionally, I employed optimistic locking mechanisms using versioning in our MySQL database to handle concurrent updates safely.

**Outcome**:
The use of multithreading enabled us to handle high transaction volumes efficiently, maintaining system performance and ensuring timely processing of fund transfers even during peak periods.

---

### Story 2: Implementing the Builder Design Pattern at Citizens Bank

**Question**: Where did you use the Builder design pattern in your last project?

**Answer**:

In my role at Citizens Bank, I worked on developing a microservices-based online banking platform. One of the key features we developed was the fund transfer functionality, which involved creating complex transfer requests with multiple optional parameters.

**Scenario**: We needed to construct complex transfer request objects that could include various optional attributes such as transfer notes, scheduled dates, recurring transfer options, and multi-currency support. The traditional way of creating these objects made the codebase cumbersome and difficult to maintain.

**Solution**:
I utilized the Builder design pattern to simplify the creation of these complex transfer request objects. Here’s how:

1. **Complex Transfer Request Construction**:

   - Transfer requests in our system could have numerous optional fields. Using the Builder pattern allowed us to construct these objects in a readable and manageable way.

2. **Implementing the Builder**:

   - I created a `TransferRequestBuilder` class that provided a fluent interface for setting optional attributes. Each method in the builder returned the builder instance, enabling method chaining. The final `build()` method constructed the immutable `TransferRequest` object.

3. **Improving Code Maintainability and Readability**:

   - The Builder pattern helped in segregating the complex construction logic from the `TransferRequest` class, adhering to the single responsibility principle. It also made the code more readable and easier to understand, as the creation of a transfer request object was now clear and concise.

4. **Handling Validation and Default Values**:
   - The builder also incorporated validation logic and default values for certain fields, ensuring that only valid transfer requests were created and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

**Example**:

```java
TransferRequest transferRequest = new TransferRequestBuilder()
                                     .withSourceAccount("123456789")
                                     .withDestinationAccount("987654321")
                                     .withAmount(500.00)
                                     .withCurrency("USD")
                                     .withTransferNote("Rent payment")
                                     .withScheduledDate(LocalDate.now().plusDays(1))
                                     .build();
```

**Outcome**:
Using the Builder design pattern resulted in more maintainable and robust code. It allowed our team to easily add new optional attributes to the `TransferRequest` class without affecting existing functionality, facilitating smoother feature expansions and maintenance.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Pipeline Flow:

#### 1. **Checkout Stage:**

- Pulls the latest code from the Git repository.

#### 2. **Build Stage:**

- Uses Maven to clean and build the project, compiling the code and packaging it into an artifact (e.g., JAR file).

#### 3. **Test Stage:**

- Runs unit tests using Maven to ensure code quality and functionality.

#### 4. **Docker Build and Push Stage:**

- Builds a Docker image for the application using the latest build artifacts.
- Tags the Docker image with the build number for versioning.
- Pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub or AWS ECR).

#### 5. **Deploy to Kubernetes Stage:**

- Uses `kubectl` to apply Kubernetes deployment configurations, deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster (local or another non-AWS environment).
- Uses credentials stored in Jenkins to authenticate with the Kubernetes cluster.

#### 6. **Deploy to AWS EKS Stage:**

- Updates the kubeconfig to authenticate with the AWS EKS cluster.
- Deploys the application to the AWS EKS cluster using Kubernetes deployment configurations.
- Uses AWS CLI commands to interact with the EKS cluster.

#### 7. **Notify Stage:**

- Sends an email notification to the team with the result of the pipeline execution.
