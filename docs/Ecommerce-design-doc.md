## 6. Message queue

### Message Queue Design using Kafka

#### Architecture Overview

1. **Kafka Cluster**

   - A cluster consisting of multiple Kafka brokers responsible for storing and managing topics.
   - Provides fault tolerance, scalability, and high availability.

2. **Producers**

   - Services or components that produce messages (events) to Kafka topics.
   - Examples: Order Service, Payment Service, Inventory Service.

3. **Consumers**

   - Services or components that consume messages from Kafka topics and process them asynchronously.
   - Examples: Payment Service, Order Service, Notification Service.

4. **ZooKeeper**
   - Coordinates and manages the Kafka brokers, ensuring they work together effectively.

#### Components

1. **Kafka Brokers**

   - Responsible for receiving, storing, and serving messages from producers to consumers.
   - Maintain partitions for topics and handle message replication and distribution.

2. **Producers**

   - **Order Service Producer:** Generates order events (e.g., order placed, order canceled) and publishes them to the `order_events` topic.
   - **Payment Service Producer:** Produces payment events (e.g., payment processed, refund initiated) to the `payment_events` topic.
   - **Inventory Service Producer:** Publishes inventory events (e.g., stock updated) to the `inventory_events` topic.

3. **Consumers**
   - **Payment Service Consumer:** Subscribes to the `order_events` topic, processes payment-related events, and publishes payment status updates to the `payment_events` topic.
   - **Order Service Consumer:** Listens to the `payment_events` topic, updates order status based on payment confirmation, and sends notifications to customers via the `notification_events` topic.
   - **Notification Service Consumer:** Consumes notification events from the `notification_events` topic and sends notifications (e.g., emails, SMS) to customers.

#### Topics

1. **order_events**

   - Topic for handling order-related events.
   - Messages include events such as order placed, order canceled, order updated.

2. **payment_events**

   - Topic for managing payment-related events.
   - Messages include events like payment processed, refund initiated, payment failed.

3. **inventory_events**

   - Topic for inventory-related events.
   - Messages include events such as stock updated, item availability changed.

4. **notification_events**
   - Topic for handling notification-related events.
   - Messages include events like order confirmation sent, shipment status updated.

#### Flow

##### 1. Order Placement Flow

- **Order Service Producer**

  - Generates an order event (e.g., order placed) and sends it to the `order_events` topic.

- **Payment Service Consumer**

  - Subscribes to the `order_events` topic.
  - Processes payment for the order.

## 7. biggest challenge(technical challenge)

**Answer:**

One of the biggest technical challenges I faced was during a major sales event. We experienced a significant traffic surge that caused one of our critical services to fail. This failure had a cascading effect, impacting other related services and leading to overall platform instability.

**_short version:_**

```
During a peak traffic event, one of our critical services encountered a failure, leading to a cascade effect on related services and impacting overall platform stability.

**How I handled it:**

I immediately scaled the service horizontally, implemented auto-scaling, and used a circuit breaker pattern to manage traffic. We also leveraged caching, rate limiting, and message queues to alleviate the immediate load and stabilize the system.

**Improvements made:**

Post-incident, we focused on enhancing fault tolerance, refining auto-scaling policies, and conducting thorough load testing. We also strengthened monitoring, resource allocation strategies, and disaster recovery plans to ensure better resilience in high-demand scenarios.
```

**What I did when the challenge happened:**

1. **Scaled Services Horizontally:** We quickly added more instances of the overwhelmed service behind a load balancer to distribute the traffic more evenly.
2. **Implemented Auto-Scaling:** We set up auto-scaling policies to dynamically increase the number of instances based on real-time demand.
3. **Activated Circuit Breaker Pattern:** To prevent continuous requests from hitting the failing service, we implemented a circuit breaker. This helped reroute traffic to fallback mechanisms, allowing the service time to recover.
4. **Leveraged Caching:** We used Redis to cache frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the service.
5. **Rate Limiting:** We applied rate limiting to control the number of requests per user, preventing a flood of requests from overwhelming the service.
6. **Utilized Message Queues:** By offloading non-critical tasks to Kafka message queues, we managed asynchronous tasks more effectively, reducing immediate load on the service.
7. **Enhanced Monitoring:** We closely monitored the situation using Prometheus and Grafana, setting up alerts to identify and address potential issues promptly.

**How I improved the system after the event:**

1. **Resilience Enhancements:** We implemented additional fault tolerance and resilience measures, such as service isolation and fallback strategies, to prevent cascading failures.
2. **Improved Auto-Scaling Policies:** We refined our auto-scaling policies to be more responsive to traffic patterns, ensuring better handling of future surges.
3. **Load Testing:** We conducted thorough load testing to identify and address potential bottlenecks before they became critical issues.
4. **Better Resource Allocation:** We optimized resource allocation based on historical traffic data, ensuring critical services had sufficient resources during peak times.
5. **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring:** We improved our logging and monitoring setup to gain deeper insights into service performance and potential failure points.
6. **Disaster Recovery Planning:** We developed more robust disaster recovery plans to ensure quick recovery in case of future incidents.
7. **Continuous Improvement:** We established a feedback loop for continuous improvement, regularly reviewing and updating our systems based on lessons learned from the event.

## 9.Prepare stories based on your resume: example, where did you use multithreading in your last project? Where did you use builder design patterns in your last project?

1. **Multithreading Story:**
   In our Chewy-like e-commerce system, multithreading played a crucial role in optimizing product catalog updates. Specifically, we utilized multithreading to parallelize the process of importing and updating product information from suppliers' feeds. Each thread was responsible for processing a subset of products concurrently, leveraging Java's `ExecutorService` and `Thread` classes. This approach not only accelerated the synchronization of product data but also ensured that our catalog remained up-to-date with the latest inventory and pricing information. By effectively managing concurrency, we enhanced system responsiveness and scalability, meeting the demands of high-traffic periods without compromising on data accuracy.

2. **Builder Design Pattern Story:**
   Within our Chewy-inspired e-commerce platform, we implemented the Builder design pattern to streamline the creation of complex product configurations. For instance, when introducing new product categories or customizing product bundles, we employed a ProductBuilder class. This builder encapsulated the steps for assembling product attributes, options, and pricing structures dynamically. By abstracting the construction process, we achieved greater flexibility in configuring product offerings while maintaining code clarity and reusability. This approach proved invaluable in adapting to market trends and customer preferences swiftly, empowering our platform to efficiently handle diverse product configurations and variations.

### Explanation:

- **Agent:** Specifies any available Jenkins agent to execute the pipeline stages.
- **Environment:** Defines environment variables including AWS credentials, Docker registry URL, ECS cluster name, and S3 bucket name.
- **Stages:**
  - **Build:** Builds the Docker image for your application.
  - **Test:** Runs automated tests (replace `mvn test` with your actual test commands).
  - **Deploy to ECS:** Pushes the Docker image to the registry and deploys it to ECS using `ecs-cli`.
  - **Backup to S3:** Packages artifacts (if any) and uploads them to an S3 bucket for backup or distribution.
  - **Cleanup:** Cleans up temporary artifacts after deployment.
- **Post-build Actions:** Executes actions based on pipeline outcome (success or failure).

### Notes:

- **Credentials:** Use Jenkins credentials store for sensitive data like AWS access keys and Docker registry credentials.
- **Customization:** Replace placeholders (`your-aws-region`, `your-aws-account-id`, etc.) with your actual AWS configuration.
- **Integration:** Integrate additional stages or steps as per your project's requirements (e.g., database migrations, CDN cache invalidation).

## 14. frontend story

```
In my current role, I was tasked with revamping the shopping cart page for our e-commerce platform using Angular. It was a pivotal part of the user experience, so we wanted to make it really seamless.

We designed the cart page as a dynamic Angular component. Users could see all their selected items, adjust quantities on the fly, and get instant updates on prices without having to refresh the page. It made shopping easier and more intuitive.

One of the cool things we focused on was making sure the page looked great and worked smoothly on any deviceâ€”whether you were on a desktop or shopping from your phone. That responsive design was crucial for our users.

Using Angular's HttpClient module, we hooked everything up to our backend systems flawlessly. This meant we could fetch and update cart data quickly and accurately, which was a big win for user experience.

Performance was also a big deal for us. We used techniques like lazy loading to speed up how the page loaded, minimized how many times the page had to talk to the server, and made sure we cached data smartly to keep things running smoothly.

Overall, our new Angular-powered shopping cart page really made a difference. It helped boost user engagement and cut down on people leaving their carts before checking out. Plus, it just made shopping more enjoyable for our customers, which is always the goal.

So, that project really highlighted how Angular's features let us build a user-friendly, responsive interface that met both our users' needs and our business goals.

**Designing the Shopping Cart Page with Angular**

As part of enhancing the shopping experience on our e-commerce platform similar to Chewy, I led the design and development of the shopping cart page using Angular.

**Component Overview:**

The shopping cart page was implemented as an Angular component. It featured:

- **Product Listing:** Displayed items added to the cart with details like product image, name, quantity, and price.
- **Quantity Control:** Users could adjust product quantities directly from the cart page.
- **Price Calculation:** Automatically calculated and displayed the subtotal, taxes, and total price based on the items in the cart.
- **Checkout Process:** Integrated with Angular Router to smoothly navigate users to the checkout process.

**Key Features:**

1. **Responsive Design:** Ensured the shopping cart was fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.

2. **Real-time Updates:** Utilized Angular's data binding and services to reflect real-time changes in cart items, quantities, and prices without requiring a page reload.

3. **API Integration:** Connected to backend services via Angular's HttpClient module to fetch and update cart data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

4. **User Interaction:** Implemented intuitive UI controls for users to add, remove, or adjust quantities of items in the cart, enhancing usability.

5. **Performance Optimization:** Optimized the Angular application for performance, including lazy loading modules, minimizing HTTP requests, and caching strategies to enhance load times.

**Impact:**

The Angular-powered shopping cart page resulted in improved user engagement and reduced cart abandonment rates. Its responsive design and seamless integration with backend services provided a smooth shopping experience, contributing to increased conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
